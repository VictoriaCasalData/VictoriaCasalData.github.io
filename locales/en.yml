      Creativity is one of the most valuable characteristics in someone's work. There is no
      humanity in something if it weren't for the creative factor. I believe that writing copy
      creatively not only enables connections between customer and business owner, but it also
      motivates, inspires, informs, and changes minds-as a copywriter, I strive to do exactly that.
      A strong bond is made when a good connection is formed, it is until then that credibility and
      trust further develops between two entities.
